<h2>Informed Consent  - CAREFUL CHATAI VERSION! NEEDS ADAPTATION</h2>
<p>
    <b>Purpose:</b>
    This research explores the use of generative conversational artificial intelligence (GCAI) tools in the case of
    problem-solving. Your task is to reformulate Product Backlog items to meet standard requirements. Imagine
    yourself as a novice product owner preparing for a Sprint planning meeting for the first time. We ask you
    to improve the items to the best of your abilities so that an actual team could work on fulfilling the
    customer's demands.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <b>Procedure:</b>
    Once you sign the consent form, we ask you to answer a few questions. Then you will get familiar with the integrated
    tool (ChatGPT). Then you will receive an introduction to the task. As a product owner, you will be introduced to the
    setting and the customer's needs and wishes. Then, you will receive some feedback from the scrum master. Please read
    the instructions carefully. You will be asked about your comprehension of the instructions and will only be allowed
    to proceed to the study if you answer satisfactorily.
    Based on that, we ask you to improve a product backlog item with the help of ChatGPT. Then, we ask you to answer a few
    questions about your experience and to your person. There are no right or wrong answers. Please be honest.<br/>
    The task will take approximately 20-30 minutes. We ask you to complete all the sections and not to close the browser before reaching the end.
    <b>Note that you will only be paid for your participation if you complete the task and survey
    in full</b>.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <b>Your participation:</b>
    Your participation is completely voluntary. Please note that your participation will help us gain insights into GCAI tool
    usage for problem solving. We do not anticipate any (health) risks to your participation. You can decline to participate
    and withdraw from the experiment at any time by contacting the principal investigator.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <b>Data privacy and security:</b>
    We collect survey data and the conversation logs between you and the GCAI. All data which we collect is stored on servers
    in the EU and will be treated confidentially (e.g., they will not be given to people outside the research team).

<h2>Information on approval conditions </h2>
<p>
    We appreciate your honest work. To see that your work fulfills a minimum quality standard, we set the following approval criteria for
    fair and transparent work conditions:

        acceptance criteria - please do NOT start the survey. On the next page, we will test your Scrum knowledge with a multiple choice question.
        You need to reach 50% to proceed. In case you don't reach 50%, the survey will end there and you will be rejected. </li>

    <li> <b>Duration of task</b>: We track when a worker starts and ends the survey. We understand that some people work faster, some work
         slower. We expect the absolute minimum work duration for this task to be 10 minutes and that you <b> must watch the video in its full length </b>. </li>

    <li> <b>Attention check questions</b>: We included attention check (AC) questions. You need to answer <b>all ACs correctly in

        minimum duration in the survey. Remember, in case any of the above mentioned conditions are not met, you will not get paid.</li>

    <li> <b>Mechanical Turk code</b>: At the end of the survey you will be provided with a custom completion code that we store in our
         database with your workerID. Before approval, we will check if the completion codes are the same. </li>
